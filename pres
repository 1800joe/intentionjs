JOES NOTES:
TALK ABOUT sensible css scope through class names not media queries
  todo: come up with a scenario where you want a specification that requires a. two media queries b. some info in a media query some out c. a really commplicated media query

  media queries blow (i dont think in screen widths) I do think in names
